(1) Please make it easy to contact people at the Perl foundation by listing their email addresses prominently.
(2) Perl is a language that each developer can shape to their own level of expertise through the use of pragmata. 
This leads to long lists of boiler plate 'use' statements at the front of each program.  These choices should be
settable once in an external options file.
(3) It should be possible for people to vote on Perl policy.
(4) Perl 7 will just produce another Perl 6. Much better to look for solutions like (2) above that resolve the issues through code
rather than rebranding: "united in diversity".
(5) ActiveState has too much involvement with Perl and is slowly dividing our efforts.
(6) We need more pragmata for instance:
  (a) Swap -> and .
  (b) Define new dyadic operators not redefine exsting dyadic operators
  (c) Beter constants - the current solution using subs leads to very weird results
  (d) const a = ..., b = a + ..., c = 2 *a + b ...  just like Javascript
  (e) Make semicolons optional like Javascript as this greatly tegh line noise that disfigures othersie clean Perl code
 (7) Perl monks must not be disparged - they have done sterling work for decades - if 
 you want their web site modernized offer them some incentives to do so.  
 (8) I assume Perl is a trademark? Please start suing some people (like Google) who are using the trademark inappropriately.
 (9) Get Perl into web browsers.
 (11) Create a proper debugger.
 (12) Very slowly start removing CPAN modules which are not being actively supported.
 (13) Fix the documentation on perldoc - currently it is riddled with bugs like: 
 
 S
    __SUB__
    - the current subroutine, or C if not in a subroutine 

andno matter how many times one points out this defect nothing is done about it.
 (14) The perld doc search function is absolutely useless - duckduckgo is much better at searching perl documnatation.  Please get rid of this pointless feature.
 (15) Perl functions is full of funcations like: getnetent which no ever uses yet they confuse the docuemntation for new users.  These functions should be in a separate module.
 (16) The perl decision making process is remote from the people who use perl every day: who decided that there was to be a Perl 7? As you have failed to ask the people for their opinion, so the people will deny you their support - just like Perl 6.
